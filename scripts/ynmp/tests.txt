YourNextMP updating on election night
=====================================

This script is to read in YourNextMP's CSV file and update our people.json file
to match any results of elected candidates.

First, let's get the functions and load in the existing people.json data:

    >>> from update import *
    >>> data = load_data()

And we want a function to alter the fixture with different information:

    >>> import tempfile
    >>> def alter(name, winner, pid=None):
    ...     with tempfile.TemporaryFile() as fn:
    ...         for line in open('fixture.csv'):
    ...             if line.startswith(name):
    ...                 line = '%s%s\n' % (line.strip(), winner)
    ...                 if pid:
    ...                     line = re.sub(',((,[^,]*){6})$', r',%s\1' % pid, line)
    ...             fn.write(line)
    ...         fn.seek(0)
    ...         return update_from(fn, data)

Now we want to call it with the CSV file before anything has happened:

    >>> update_from('fixture.csv', data)
    False

Diane Abbott wins:

    >>> alter('Diane Abbott', 'True')
    NEW result 40706, Diane Abbott, Labour, Hackney North and Stoke Newington, uk.org.publicwhip/person/10001
    True

Nick Clegg loses:

    >>> alter('Peter Garbutt', 'True')
    NEW result 40707, Peter Garbutt, Green, Sheffield, Hallam, uk.org.publicwhip/person/25268
    True

Actually, that was a mistake at the YNMP end, now fixed by them:

    >>> alter('Nick Clegg', 'True')
    Updating uk.org.publicwhip/member/40707 with Nick Clegg, Liberal Democrat, Sheffield, Hallam, uk.org.publicwhip/person/11812
    True

Alex Salmond wins, and YNMP have supplied his parlparse ID:

    >>> alter('Alex Salmond', 'True', 'uk.org.publicwhip/person/10525')
    NEW result 40708, Alex Salmond, Scottish National Party, Gordon, uk.org.publicwhip/person/10525
    True

David Drew wins, and YNMP have not supplied his parlparse ID (he was an MP until 2010):

    >>> alter('David Drew', 'True')
    NEW result 40709, David Drew, Labour/Co-operative, Stroud, uk.org.publicwhip/person/25269
    True
