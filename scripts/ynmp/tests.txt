YourNextMP updating on election night
=====================================

This script is to read in YourNextMP's CSV file and update our people.json file
to match any results of elected candidates.

First, let's get the functions and load in the existing people.json data:

    >>> from update import *
    >>> data = load_data()

And we want a function to alter the fixture with different information:

    >>> import StringIO, csv
    >>> source = open('fixture-2017.csv').readlines()
    >>> def alter(name, winner, pid=None):
    ...     global source
    ...     reader = csv.DictReader(source)
    ...     fn = None
    ...     s = StringIO.StringIO()
    ...     for line in reader:
    ...         if not fn:
    ...             fn = csv.DictWriter(s, reader.fieldnames)
    ...             fn.writeheader()
    ...         if line['name'] == name:
    ...             line['elected'] = winner
    ...             if pid:
    ...                 line['parlparse_id'] = pid
    ...         fn.writerow(line)
    ...     s.seek(0)
    ...     source = s.readlines()
    ...     s.seek(0)
    ...     return update_from(s, data)

Now we want to call it with the CSV file before anything has happened:

    >>> update_from(source, data)
    False

Diane Abbott wins:

    >>> alter('Diane Abbott', 'True')
    NEW result 41731, Diane Abbott, Labour, Hackney North and Stoke Newington, uk.org.publicwhip/person/10001
    True

Nick Clegg loses:

    >>> alter('Logan Robin', 'True')
    NEW result 41372, Logan Robin, Green, Sheffield, Hallam, uk.org.publicwhip/person/25611
    True

Actually, that was a mistake at the YNMP end, revert until we know the result:

    >>> alter('Logan Robin', 'False')
    Removing result from uk.org.publicwhip/member/41372 (was Logan Robin, Green, Sheffield, Hallam, )
    True

It turns out Nick Clegg actually won:

    >>> alter('Nick Clegg', 'True')
    Updating uk.org.publicwhip/member/41372 with Nick Clegg, Liberal Democrat, Sheffield, Hallam, uk.org.publicwhip/person/11812
    True

Alex Salmond wins, and YNMP have supplied his parlparse ID:

    >>> alter('Alex Salmond', 'True', 'uk.org.publicwhip/person/10525')
    NEW result 41373, Alex Salmond, Scottish National Party, Gordon, uk.org.publicwhip/person/10525
    True

Two David Jones both win, one with a person ID, one without:

    >>> alter('David Jones', 'True')
    NEW result 41374, David Jones, Green, Blackley and Broughton, uk.org.publicwhip/person/25612
    NEW result 41375, David Jones, Conservative, Clwyd West, uk.org.publicwhip/person/11506
    True

Tessa Jane Munt wins, and YNMP have not supplied her parlparse ID (she was an MP until 2015):

    >>> alter('Tessa Jane Munt', 'True')
    NEW result 41376, Tessa Jane Munt, Liberal Democrat, Wells, uk.org.publicwhip/person/25613
    True

If we then just run again with no changes, nothing should happen:

    >>> update_from(source, data)
    False
